(He leaves)
Death: (Thought) I know I’m a personification of death and everything, but you’d think people
would have the decency to not run and scream. (Checks watch) Hm, I’m running a bit behind on
my quota, I’ll have to reap a soul if I want to keep searching for Boney tonight.
(Tutorials for changing to the underworld happens)
Death: To Reap a soul, I have to… Hang on, I’ll check the manual.
(The player changes to the Underworld)
The Manuel: (Tells the player how to reap a soul)
(The soul gets reaped)
Villager: OH NO, PLEASE, I CAN’T GO, SOMEONE WILL STEAL MY BUCKET!

Death: (Thought) Okay, might have accidentally reaped an unprepared soul, the big folks
upstairs do not like this sort of thing, I’ll probably have to be a bit more cautious about this sort
of thing. I’ll have to file the 666 forms after tonight, but first, I want my dog back.
